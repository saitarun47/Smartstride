# Smartstride

**Smart Intelligence** is an AI-powered system (agentic ai) that leverages Strava activity data to deliver personalized, and data-driven feedback for athletes. Designed for runners, cyclists, and swimmers, this project combines state-of-the-art retrieval augmented generation (RAG), vector search, and automated email reporting to help users unlock their full athletic potential.
